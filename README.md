## Setup

To compile the Android project, you'll need to install Eclipse EE and install all necessary Android 
utilities as described on the official Android page (http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).  
You'll also need to install the Facebook SDK and follow their directions (http://developers.facebook.com/docs/mobile/android/build/).

To compile the Google App Engine (GAE) project, you'll need to install the GAE SDK for Java (https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).
You do NOT have to use my own Google Account to modify our website:  the code for the website is simply code, and you
can deploy for free using any Google web account (it just won't be at ruzenafit.appspot.com unless I deploy it).
